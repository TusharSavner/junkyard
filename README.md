#junkyard

This repository is my digital junk drawer—a place where I stash every script, snippet, config, and idea that pops into existence. It’s not meant to be elegant, organized, or even mildly coherent. If you stumbled in here looking for polished code, friendly advice: back away slowly and pretend you never saw this.
That said, if you do find something useful... huh, cool. Pure accident, I promise.
